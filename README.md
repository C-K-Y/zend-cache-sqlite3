###Installation

First of all, choose a way to implement your cache.

1. Native built-in SQLite3 feature (in native folder)
2. PDO

Download the SQLite3.php file and copy it under the ./library/Zend/Cache/Backend/ folder.

Change your "Sqlite" parameter on cache factory to **Sqlite3**.

Thats all.
